TIDED

A cross-platform text editor using Scintilla. 

Who needs another text editor? Well this ones uses the Scintilla component (much like SciTE) and runs on OSX which is a major bonus. I've had this code here for years -- this project began back in 2008 or 2009 -- and I've decided to release it open source. 

I wrote this because at the time, I couldn't get Scintilla on OSX. I hope it's of some use though as of release, it can view files but has niggling little problems and is most definitely a work in progress. It does, however, have promise.

It also has syntax highlighting, line numbers and lots of other things too.
